# 
## Overview
This document provides an overview of the solution architecture designed to enable a secure and automated file upload system to AWS S3, along with automated notification to an admin upon successful file uploads.

## Problem Statement
A company needs a secure and automated way for clients to upload files to AWS S3. After a file is uploaded, the system should notify an admin via email without requiring manual monitoring.

## Solution Architecture
By leveraging AWS S3, SNS, and Lambda, we create a serverless, event-driven solution that automates notifications upon file uploads.

## Architecture Flow
1. **Client Uploads a File**
    - The client submits a file to an S3 bucket using a web app or AWS SDK.
2. **S3 Event Notification**
    - S3 triggers an event notification on a successful upload.
3. **AWS Lambda Execution**
    - The event triggers a Lambda function that processes metadata (e.g., filename, timestamp).
4. **SNS Notification**
    - Lambda publishes a message to an Amazon SNS topic.
5. **Admin Receives Email**
    - SNS sends an email notification to the admin with file details.
## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3**
    - Stores uploaded files.
- **AWS Lambda**
    - Processes file upload events.
- **Amazon SNS**
    - Sends email notifications.
## Key Components
### File Upload
- **Tools for Upload**
    - Clients can use a web app to upload files to the S3 bucket.
### Security Considerations
- **Authentication and Authorization**
    - Implement necessary security measures to ensure secure file uploads.
## Email Notification Details
- **Information Included**
    - Filename
    - Upload timestamp
## Conclusion
This document outlines the architecture and flow of the secure and automated file upload system to AWS S3, highlighting the use of AWS services to achieve a seamless and efficient process.
